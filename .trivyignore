# SQS queue not using a customer-managed KMS key.
# The module defaults to creating a CMK (create_kms_key = true).
# This finding only appears when kms_master_key_id = null, create_kms_key = false,
# and use_sqs_managed_sse = false (i.e., falling back to the AWS-managed key alias/aws/sqs).

# SQS queue policy allows access without a source ARN condition.
# The queue policy enforces SSL (enforce_ssl = true by default) and scopes
# access to the queue owner account. The allowed_services condition is
# already guarded by aws:SourceArn in policies.tf.
